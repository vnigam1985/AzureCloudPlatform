# üõ°Ô∏è Proxy-as-a-Service Monitoring Options (with Technical Details)

---

## 1. Synthetic Health Checks (VM-Based Monitoring)

- **What it Monitors:**  
  - Proxy reachability (Up/Down)  
  - Proxy response time (Optional)

- **How it Works:**  
  A lightweight VM runs automated scripts (ping or HTTP requests) through the proxy every few minutes to test availability.

- **Objective** 

Monitor the availability of a Proxy (e.g., Netskope Proxy) by:
- Running health checks every 5 minutes from a Linux VM.
- Capturing proxy status (UP/DOWN).
- Automatically sending logs to Azure Log Analytics.
- Triggering alerts and building visual dashboards.

- **Technical Implementation:**  
  - Deploy small Linux VM in Azure.
  - Use `curl` or `ping` to test proxy connectivity.
  - Log results locally.
  - Push logs into Azure Log Analytics.
  - Create alerts if proxy becomes unreachable.

- **Architecture**  

```plaintext
Linux VM (Scheduled Health Check Script)
    ‚Üì
/var/log/proxy_health.log
    ‚Üì
Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)
    ‚Üì
Azure Log Analytics Workspace
    ‚Üì
Azure Workbooks / Alerts
```

- **Pros:**  
  ‚úÖ Very easy to implement  
  ‚úÖ Cheap (~$7-10/month for VM)  
  ‚úÖ Works with any proxy

- **Cons:**  
  ‚ùå Only monitors if proxy is reachable, not deep performance metrics  
  ‚ùå Slightly manual if scaling to multiple proxies

## 2. Azure Monitor with Log Analytics

- **What it Monitors:**  
  - Proxy uptime/down status  
  - VPN Tunnel health (via VPN Gateway metrics)

- **How it Works:**  
  Centralizes proxy health logs and VPN tunnel metrics into Azure's monitoring platform for dashboards, reports, and alerts.

- **Technical Implementation:**  
  - Create a Log Analytics Workspace.
  - Configure VM logs and Azure VPN Gateway metrics to flow into Log Analytics.
  - Build custom dashboards using Azure Workbooks.
  - Create alert rules based on proxy downtime or tunnel failures.

- **Pros:**  
  ‚úÖ Full visibility across environment  
  ‚úÖ Native Azure integration  
  ‚úÖ Easy alerting and visualization

- **Cons:**  
  ‚ùå Requires initial setup of log ingestion  
  ‚ùå Some tuning needed for custom queries

## 3. Application Insights Synthetic Tests

- **What it Monitors:**  
  - External URL availability  
  - Response time and error codes

- **How it Works:**  
  Azure Application Insights can simulate user-like traffic to a public URL to check availability.

- **Technical Implementation:**  
  - Create Application Insights resource.
  - Set up **Standard Availability Tests** targeting external URLs.
  - Schedule tests from multiple Azure regions.
  - (‚ö° Note: Cannot test internal proxy directly ‚Äî requires custom synthetic testing from a VM.)

- **üõ†Ô∏è Architecture**

```plaintext
Azure Application Insights (Availability Test)
    ‚Üì
HTTP/S Test to Target Endpoint (through Proxy/Public)
    ‚Üì
Alert on Failure
    ‚Üì
Visual Dashboards (Availability, Latency Trends)
```

- **Pros:**  
  ‚úÖ Realistic user simulation (HTTP GET)  
  ‚úÖ Easy visualization and built-in SLA tracking

- **Cons:**  
  ‚ùå Cannot directly monitor internal proxies without VM workaround  
  ‚ùå Not deep monitoring unless customized

---

## 4. Network Device Metrics (Firewalls/VPN Gateways)

- **What it Monitors:**  
  - Tunnel connection uptime  
  - Packet loss, latency, throughput

- **How it Works:**  
  Leverage network appliances (Azure Firewall, VPN Gateways, on-prem devices) which already track IPsec tunnel health.

- **Technical Implementation:**  
  - Enable Azure NSG Flow Logs or Firewall Logs.
  - Parse connection stats via Log Analytics.
  - Set metric-based alerts if tunnels disconnect or traffic drops.

- **Pros:**  
  ‚úÖ No need for new monitoring agents  
  ‚úÖ Covers all network layers (tunnels, IP drops, latency)

- **Cons:**  
  ‚ùå Might not give direct proxy server health  
  ‚ùå Log parsing can be complex depending on the device
