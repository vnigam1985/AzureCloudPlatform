# üõ°Ô∏è Proxy-as-a-Service Monitoring Options (with Technical Details)

---

## 1. Synthetic Health Checks (VM-Based Monitoring)

- **What it Monitors:**  
  - Proxy reachability (Up/Down)  
  - Proxy response time (Optional)

- **How it Works:**  
  A lightweight VM runs automated scripts (ping or HTTP requests) through the proxy every few minutes to test availability.

- **Objective** 

Monitor the availability of a Proxy (e.g., Netskope Proxy) by:
- Running health checks every 5 minutes from a Linux VM.
- Capturing proxy status (UP/DOWN).
- Automatically sending logs to Azure Log Analytics.
- Triggering alerts and building visual dashboards.

- **Technical Implementation:**  
  - Deploy small Linux VM in Azure.
  - Use `curl` or `ping` to test proxy connectivity.
  - Log results locally.
  - Push logs into Azure Log Analytics.
  - Create alerts if proxy becomes unreachable.

- **Architecture**  

```plaintext
Linux VM (Scheduled Health Check Script)
    ‚Üì
/var/log/proxy_health.log
    ‚Üì
Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)
    ‚Üì
Azure Log Analytics Workspace
    ‚Üì
Azure Workbooks / Alerts
```

- **Install Azure Monitor Agent** 
SSH into your VM and install the agent:
```bash
wget https://aka.ms/InstallAzureMonitorAgentLinux -O InstallAzureMonitorAgentLinux.sh
sudo bash InstallAzureMonitorAgentLinux.sh
```

- **Create the Proxy Health Check Script**
- Create a script file /opt/monitoring/proxy_health_check.sh:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Proxy address or FQDN
PROXY_ADDRESS="your.proxy.address"

# Log file location
LOG_FILE="/var/log/proxy_health.log"

# Current timestamp
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")

# Perform health check
ping -c 4 $PROXY_ADDRESS > /dev/null

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    STATUS="UP"
else
    STATUS="DOWN"
fi

# Write result into log file
echo "{\"timestamp\":\"$TIMESTAMP\", \"proxy_status\":\"$STATUS\"}" >> $LOG_FILE
```
- Make the script executable: 
```bash
sudo chmod +x /opt/monitoring/proxy_health_check.sh
```

Schedule the Script using Cron
Open the crontab editor:

```bash
crontab -e
```
- Add this line to run the script every 5 minutes:

```bash
*/5 * * * * /opt/monitoring/proxy_health_check.sh
```
‚úÖ Now the health check will run every 5 minutes and write to /var/log/proxy_health.log.

- **Set Up Data Collection Rule (DCR) in Azure**

- Go to Azure Portal ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí Data Collection Rules.

- Create a new DCR:

    - Target Platform: Linux

    - Target Resource: Select your Linux VM

    - Data Sources ‚Üí Collect Custom Logs

    - Log File Path: /var/log/proxy_health.log

    - Destination: Send to your Log Analytics Workspace

    - Give it a name like proxy-health-dcr

- Or use below YAML to create DCR

```yaml
location: your-region
properties:
  dataSources:
    customLogs:
    - streams:
      - Custom-ProxyHealth
      filePatterns:
      - /var/log/proxy_health.log
      name: ProxyHealthLogs
  destinations:
    logAnalytics:
    - workspaceResourceId: /subscriptions/your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/your-rg-name/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/your-laworkspace
      name: LAWorkspaceDestination
  dataFlows:
  - streams:
    - Custom-ProxyHealth
    destinations:
    - LAWorkspaceDestination
```

- Replace:
    -your-region
    - your-subscription-id
    - your-rg-name
    - your-laworkspace
with your real values.

- Create the DCR using Azure CLI:

```bash
az monitor data-collection rule create --resource-group your-rg-name --name proxy-health-dcr --location your-region --rule proxy-health-dcr.yaml
```

- **Verify Log Collection**

    -  Go to Log Analytics Workspace ‚Üí Logs.
    - Run a query:
```kusto
CustomLog_CL
| where SourceSystem == "Linux"
| where RawData contains "proxy_status"
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
```
‚úÖ You should see entries like:

```json
{"timestamp":"2024-04-27T18:00:00Z", "proxy_status":"UP"}
{"timestamp":"2024-04-27T18:05:00Z", "proxy_status":"UP"}
{"timestamp":"2024-04-27T18:10:00Z", "proxy_status":"DOWN"}
```
- **How to Create Alerts**
    - Go to Azure Monitor ‚Üí Alerts ‚Üí Create New Alert Rule.
    - Target your Log Analytics workspace.
    - Create a condition like:
```kusto
CustomLog_CL
| where RawData contains "proxy_status\":\"DOWN"
```
    - Set alert to fire if count > 0 in last 5 minutes.

    - Attach an Action Group (Email, Teams, SMS).
    
‚úÖ You will now get notified if proxy becomes unreachable!

- **Visualization**
    - Go to Azure Monitor ‚Üí Workbooks.
    - Create a simple graph showing Proxy Status over Time based on logs.

```kusto
CustomLog_CL
| extend Status = extract(@"proxy_status\":\"(UP|DOWN)", 1, RawData)
| summarize count() by Status, bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
| render timechart
```

- **Pros:**  
  ‚úÖ Very easy to implement  
  ‚úÖ Cheap (~$7-10/month for VM)  
  ‚úÖ Works with any proxy

- **Cons:**  
  ‚ùå Only monitors if proxy is reachable, not deep performance metrics  
  ‚ùå Slightly manual if scaling to multiple proxies

---

## 2. Azure Monitor with Log Analytics

- **What it Monitors:**  
  - Proxy uptime/down status  
  - VPN Tunnel health (via VPN Gateway metrics)

- **How it Works:**  
  Centralizes proxy health logs and VPN tunnel metrics into Azure's monitoring platform for dashboards, reports, and alerts.

- **Technical Implementation:**  
  - Create a Log Analytics Workspace.
  - Configure VM logs and Azure VPN Gateway metrics to flow into Log Analytics.
  - Build custom dashboards using Azure Workbooks.
  - Create alert rules based on proxy downtime or tunnel failures.

- **Pros:**  
  ‚úÖ Full visibility across environment  
  ‚úÖ Native Azure integration  
  ‚úÖ Easy alerting and visualization

- **Cons:**  
  ‚ùå Requires initial setup of log ingestion  
  ‚ùå Some tuning needed for custom queries

---

## 3. Application Insights Synthetic Tests

- **What it Monitors:**  
  - External URL availability  
  - Response time and error codes

- **How it Works:**  
  Azure Application Insights can simulate user-like traffic to a public URL to check availability.

- **Technical Implementation:**  
  - Create Application Insights resource.
  - Set up **Standard Availability Tests** targeting external URLs.
  - Schedule tests from multiple Azure regions.
  - (‚ö° Note: Cannot test internal proxy directly ‚Äî requires custom synthetic testing from a VM.)

- **Pros:**  
  ‚úÖ Realistic user simulation (HTTP GET)  
  ‚úÖ Easy visualization and built-in SLA tracking

- **Cons:**  
  ‚ùå Cannot directly monitor internal proxies without VM workaround  
  ‚ùå Not deep monitoring unless customized

---

## 4. Network Device Metrics (Firewalls/VPN Gateways)

- **What it Monitors:**  
  - Tunnel connection uptime  
  - Packet loss, latency, throughput

- **How it Works:**  
  Leverage network appliances (Azure Firewall, VPN Gateways, on-prem devices) which already track IPsec tunnel health.

- **Technical Implementation:**  
  - Enable Azure NSG Flow Logs or Firewall Logs.
  - Parse connection stats via Log Analytics.
  - Set metric-based alerts if tunnels disconnect or traffic drops.

- **Pros:**  
  ‚úÖ No need for new monitoring agents  
  ‚úÖ Covers all network layers (tunnels, IP drops, latency)

- **Cons:**  
  ‚ùå Might not give direct proxy server health  
  ‚ùå Log parsing can be complex depending on the device
